 # MNIST Drilldown -
 ## Aim - 
 1. 99.4% (this must be consistently shown in your last few epochs, and not a one-time achievement)
 2. Less than or equal to 15 Epochs
 3. Less than 10000 Parameters
 4. Achieve this in 3 stages,each with clear targets and results and reasons how to improve the  current result
